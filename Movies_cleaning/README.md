<hr>
This project is a data cleaning project, this project involvs one very important aspect of Data Analytics or any data related field <b>"Data Cleaning"</b>, I got a dataset from Kaggle that contains the details of Movies, the columns in the dataset are; MOVIES, YEAR, GENRE, RATING, ONE-LINE, STARS, VOTES, RunTime and Gross. The task was simple "CLEAN THE DATA", I utilized a tool I am comfortable with 'Python', I've been on this task for a while because I was having issues with a partcular column but, at the end of this task I learnt a part of Regex Expressions (Regex), I used a regex pattern to accomplish the task.

Attached to this repository is the Report and the Data Cleaning file.
